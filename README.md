For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

Back-end :
    - [REST](http://www.drdobbs.com/web-development/restful-web-services-a-tutorial/240169069) - stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol
    It provides:
    Separation between the client and the server: the REST protocol totally separates the user interface from the server and the data storage.
    Visibility, reliability and scalability. The separation between client and server has one evident advantage, and that is that each development team can scale the product without too much problem.
    The REST API is always independent of the type of platform or languages: the REST API always adapts to the type of syntax or platforms being used, which gives considerable freedom when changing or testing new environments within the development.
